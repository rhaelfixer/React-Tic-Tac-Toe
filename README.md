# React Tic Tac Toe
## Introduction
My personal React Tic Tac Toe project, where players can participate in matches. While it's not a multiplayer project, it offers an exciting gaming experience for Player 1 and Player 2 to face off in intense battles.


## Key Features
- **Player Name Customization:** Players can enter custom names before starting a game.
- **New Game:** Resets the score to zero and allows players to re-enter their names before starting a new match.
- **Reset Game:** Restarts the current match without changing player names or scores.
- **Responsive Design:** Experience seamless gameplay across all devices and screen sizes.
