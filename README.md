# React Tic Tac Toe
## Introduction
My personal React Tic Tac Toe project, where players can participate in matches. While it's not a multiplayer project, it offers an exciting gaming experience for Player 1 and Player 2 to face off in intense battles.


## Key Features
- **Players Name Change:** Players can create their names.
- **New Game:** Starting a new game resets the score to 0 and allows players to set their names.
- **Reset Game:** Reset the current match.
- **Responsive Design:** Play the game seamlessly across various devices.
